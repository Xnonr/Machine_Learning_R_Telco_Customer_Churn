A relatively simple R package designed specifically for the Telco Customer Churn dataset publically available on the website kaggle.

The code has 2 main functions:
1st - Identify the most optimal prices to charge each specific customer segment for each specific product bundle combination so as to maximize revenue.

Tools used:
Decision Tree
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Naive Bayes Classifier
Ensemble Modeling
